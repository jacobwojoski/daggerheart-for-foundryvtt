# daggerheart-for-foundryvtt
Have some fun trying to make a daggerheart system foundry foundry vtt using SASS and Typescript

## My Setup Guide

### Getting started (You shouldn't need to do this part)
- I got the boilerplate template from https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate/blob/main/system.json
- Edited the boilerplate to use my system name and settings

## Setup Typescript
- install npm and typescript
- cd into system directory
- run `npm i typescript --save-dev`
- run `npx tsc --init`
- open tsconfig.json and set values according to https://bringingfire.com/blog/intro-to-foundry-module-development

## Setup Sass

## NOTE: 
- USE GLOBAL PROGRESS CLOCKS MODULE FOR FEAR TRACKING!
